## Try Hack Me


## Your first challenge
We are given an image to download; in this image is a populated street with the sign "Carnaby Street." Easy enough!
What street is this image taken on?


Just google it.
We are given another image of a train station going underground.


What city is this station in? London, after a fast reverse image search, we discover these style stations are in London!


What station do these stairs lead to? Piccadilly Circus; we also found this when doing our reverse image search and comparing the results to our task image.


When did this station open? 1906, also found via a quick search.


How many platforms are in this station? 4, also Google...



## Keep at it!
We are once again given an image; in this image, we see an assortment of tables and people in a mall-style setting.


Which building was this photo taken in? After a reverse image lookup, this is YVR Vancouver International Airport.


Which country is this in? Canada, duh


Which city is in the photo? Richmond, as we already know where the image is, so we just googled the address.



Coffee and a light brunch
In this task file, we have an image of a cafe.


Which city is this coffee shop located in? We do another reverse image search and get the TripAdvisor page with all the details of the coffee shop; alternatively,  you can google the name of the business in the background and cross-reference it with the image results.


What street is the cafe on? This is also found on the TripAdvisor page. 1 Allan Street


What is their cellphone number? Once again, also on the TripAdvisor page. 44 7878 839128


What is their email? For this one, I navigated to their linked Facebook page from Trip Advisor and to the about section: theweecoffeeshop@aol.com.


What is the surname of the owners? I simply googled the cafe + "owner" and was handed over to Cochrane.



Reverse your thinking.
Once again, we are provided with an image of a diner of some sort.


Which restaurant was this picture taken at? Another simple reverse search gives us the name and tripadvisor...


What is the name of the Bon Appétit editor who worked 24 hours at this restaurant? To find this, I googled 'Bon Appétit editor Katz Deli', and the first link is an article as well as a video disclosing the name: Andrew Knowlton



## Located this sculpture
In this section, we are provided an image of an art piece.


What is the name of this statue? Rudolph the Chrome-nosed Reindeer is found simply with a reverse search leading to a Facebook post with the name and the image.


Who took this image? For this one, I used the hint provided, which advises you to visit the Visitoslo website. Upon doing this, you can click the sculpture, and below it, the credits are under: Kjersti Stensrud



## And justice for all
We are given an image of a statue again.


What is the name of this statue? Given a quick reverse search, this is Lady Justice.


Where is this statue located? So after some scrolling, I realized this is the name of a vast number of similar statues. After some keywords and scrolling, I found a different angle of our statue in question with the top of a sign that reads "Bryan United States Courthouse." Got it! alexandria virginia


What is the name of the building opposite this statue? For this, I view the courthouse on Streetview and turn around. We see the words "The Westin", This is too short for our flag, so I googled Westinin Alexandria, and we got our flag, "The Westin Alexandria Old Town."



## The view from my hotel room
This final section provides us with a video of a hotel room rather than an image.


What is the name of the hotel that my friend stayed at a few years ago? My first approach is going to be analyzing standout images within the video and seeing if I can reverse-search a city. To no surprise, a quick screenshot and reverse image search let us know we are in Singapore. My next step is to locate this rainbow building, then streetview to get a view of where this video is recorded from.


### scratch that!
While trying to locate this building, I came across the image linked to a blog post. This blog post is from the person in question; it includes everything we need, including our flag: Novotel Singapore, Clarke Quay
